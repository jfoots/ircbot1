# NewKarma
A heavily modified version of the original "Karma" plugin from supybot.  All the horrible coding is mine, not the original authors. :)

Seriously, this thing is in dire need of a fairly serious rewrite.  However, it needed a new home, so here it is in all of its poorly-written glory!

## Why?  The Karma plugin for supybot is just fine!

Yes, yes it is.  However, my friends and I use this plugin in a tiny channel, and we wanted to see if we could warp it to suit our specific purposes.  To that end, here are a few of the tweaks you will find in this version:

* Aliases - You can add and remove aliases to things, and when those aliases have karma modified, the original thing receives the modification
* Customizable karma responses - Your bot can be configred to say whatever your heart desires when karma is modified!
* nicks that already have "--" in them are handled properly - The same is *not* yet true of "++"
* More little stuff, I'm sure.

Now that it has a home and I can track it, I'll clean it up, promise! :)
